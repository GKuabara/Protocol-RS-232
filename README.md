## Description

Activity consists in a basic/minimium implementation of the RS-232 Protocol between two arduino uno to send a string from one arduino to the other using a parity bit as error detection method.

The repo constains both transmitter and receiver code in their respective folders.

Also, the error detection method used was an **odd** parity bit at the transmition of each char.
